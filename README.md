An interactive voice assistant that helps you in your day today coding life. 

Here are some ways where Jarvis can be helpful.

1. To search something in wikipedia, say **'(word) wikipedia'**.
  Example: Bengaluru wikipedia

2. To ask the time, say **'what's the time'** or **'time please'**

3. To open your favorite IDE or application, say **'open (application)'**
  Example: open pycharm
  (Please provide the absolute path of the application) in path [line 74 in assistant.py]

4. To get some headlines of news, say **'news'** or **'get me some news'**
 
5. To open youtube, say **'open youtube'**
  
6. To open cammand prompt, say **'open command prompt'** or **'get me the command prompt'**

7. You can ask Jarvis to play your favorite song on youtube by saying **'play any song'**, if you specify the song when it asks. If no specific 
  songs are given, it will play any song of the following genres: 
  **'romantic, pop, classical, happy, calm, emotional, festive, jazz, blues, melody, lofi, opera, instrumental, senti'**
  [Works best if you have YouTube Premium membership as it doesn't play the ads].
 
8. If you have any important files or books in folders, and you don't want to open it manually, you can just say **'open <folder_name>'**
  or **'open (something)'**
  Example: I have a folder of my reading books. I just say **open my library**
  (Please provide the absolute path of the folder)
  
9. Say **'exit'** to quit Jarvis
